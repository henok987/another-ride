## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. **Import the Collection**
```bash
# Import these files into Postman:
- Comprehensive_Ride_Service_API.postman_collection.json
- Comprehensive_Ride_Service_Environment.postman_environment.json
```

### 2. **Select Environment**
- Choose "Comprehensive Ride Service Environment" in Postman

### 3. **Start Testing**
- Begin with Authentication endpoints to get tokens
- Follow the organized folder structure
- Use the automated test scripts for validation

### 4. **Example Workflow**
```
1. Passenger Register/Login → Get passenger token
2. Find Available Drivers → Search for nearby drivers  
3. Estimate Fare → Get fare estimate
4. Create Booking → Book a ride
5. Update Location → Share pickup location
6. Track Progress → Monitor ride progress
7. Rate Driver → Provide feedback
```
